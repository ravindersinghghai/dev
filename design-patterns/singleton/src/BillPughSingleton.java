/**
 * Prior to Java 5, java memory model had a lot of issues with other approaches, they would fail in certain
 * scenarios where too many threads try to get the instance of the Singleton class simultaneously. So Bill
 * Pugh came up with a different approach to create the Singleton class using a inner static helper class.
 *
 * Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of the singleton class. When the
 * singleton class is loaded, SingletonHelper class is not loaded into memory and only when someone calls
 * the getInstance method, this class gets loaded and creates the Singleton class instance.
 *
 * This is the most widely used approach for Singleton class as it doesnâ€™t require synchronization.
